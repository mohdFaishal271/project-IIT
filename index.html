    <br><h4>YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH NATURES</h4>
    <P>I have seen, through my own experience and that of many others, 
        how profound moments with nature foster a true and vital 
        understanding of our place in the world.
         I remember an experience I had as a five-year-old boy that 
         awakened in me a life-long fascination for marshes, birds, 
         and for a life lived wild and free</P>

    <!-- <h4>EXPERIENCE YOU NEVER HAD BEFORE</h4> 
    <P>I had never experienced the pain and the grief associated with death before.
        I didn't know what falling in love was, so I had never experienced it.
        And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward, 
        there were moments of incredible depth and richness, 
        of authenticity and connection that I had never experienced befor</P>    -->

        <br>ROUTES YOU NEVER TOOK <br><br> <i><h>I never journeyed through the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, 
            marveling at its mystical beauty. The Silk Road's fabled path, 
            connecting civilizations, eluded my steps. 
            The Arctic's icy wilderness remained untrodden, 
            where polar bears roam. 
            I missed the chance to witness the breathtaking serenity of 
            New Zealand's Milford Sound. The bustling streets of Tokyo, 
            pulsating with vibrant energy, were never mine to explore. 
            The Amazon rainforest's hidden wonders, veiled in lush greenery, 
            remained a mystery. And the vast savannas of Africa,
             home to majestic wildlife, echoed with my absence. Yet,
              these paths await, calling for future adventures to unfold.
